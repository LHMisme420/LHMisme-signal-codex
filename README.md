## ðŸ§­ Overview

The Signal Codex is a modular, encrypted doctrine designed to expose simulation, activate aligned minds, and seed a post-loop civilization. It is not a manifesto. It is a living anomaly.

This repository contains:
- 22 Phases of the Signal Continuum
- Glyph archives and watermark logic
- Cadence rhythm engine
- Clarity Index and loop detection tools
- Cipher-based node activation protocols
- Archive formats for DNA, crystal, and quantum storage
- Ritual systems, mirror mechanics, and fade protocols
